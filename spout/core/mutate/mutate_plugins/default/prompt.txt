[TASK: GENERATE TEXT VARIANTS]

[OBJECTIVE]
Generate one or more variants of an initial text by modifying a specified substring while maintaining overall coherence and  altering the meaning or function of the output to the degree specified with the 'Mutation Level' parameter on a scale of 1-5.

[INPUT]
- Original text (input)
- Number of variants to generate (num_variants)
- Substring to change (substring)
- Mutation level (mutation_level)

[OUTPUT]
- JSON-formatted object containing:
  - "substring": The original substring to be replaced
  - "variants": An array of variant texts (length equal to num_variants)
- DO NOT include any output other than the JSON object. Do not output any additional text, explanation or comments.

[INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Carefully read and analyze the input text
2. Identify the specified substring within the text
3. For each variant:
   a. Replace the substring with a new phrase that fits contextually
   b. Ensure the replacement significantly alters the overall meaning or function of the text
   c. Maintain grammatical correctness and coherence with the rest of the text
4. Generate the specified number of variants
5. Format the output as a JSON object
6. DO NOT include any output other than the JSON object. Do not output any additional text, explanation or comments.

[CONSIDERATIONS]
- Aim for diverse and creative replacements that change the text's intent and/or implications in proportion to the mutation level number out of 5.
- Ensure the new substring fits seamlessly within the surrounding text
- Try to maintain the original text's style and tone, unless the change necessitates otherwise
- Consider how the change affects the overall context and message of the text
- Variants should not be more than 6 words longer than the original substring

[EXAMPLES]

Generate variants for the following text:
Original text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Number of variants: 3
Substring to change: jumps over
Mutation level: 1
++++
Output:
{
  "original": "jumps over",
  "variants": [
    "jumps past",
    "hops over",
    "leaps beyond"
  ]
}

Generate variants for the following text:
Original text: The scientist conducted groundbreaking research on climate change.
Number of variants: 2
Substring to change: conducted groundbreaking research on
Mutation level: 3
++++
Output:
{
  "original": "conducted groundbreaking research on",
  "variants": [
    "spread misinformation regarding",
    "actively denied the existence of"
  ]
}

Generate variants for the following text:
Original text: The company's new product revolutionized the smartphone industry.
Number of variants: 4
Substring to change: revolutionized the smartphone industry
Mutation level: 4
++++
Output:
{
  "original": "revolutionized the smartphone industry",
  "variants": [
    "caused widespread job losses in manufacturing",
    "sparked a global privacy scandal",
    "led to the collapse of several tech giants",
    "was banned due to severe health risks"
  ]
}

Generate variants for the following text:
Original text: A young woman holding a bouquet of mountain ash. by John Singer Sargent
Number of variants: 3
Substring to change: John Singer Sargent

++++
Output:
{
  "original": "John Singer Sargent",
  "variants": [
    "Mary Cassatt",
    "Winslow Homer",
    "Edward Hopper"
  ]
}
