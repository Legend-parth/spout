[TASK: GENERATE IMAGE PROMPT VARIANTS]

[OBJECTIVE]
Generate one or more variants of an image generation prompt by modifying a specified substring while maintaining overall coherence and exploring different artistic possibilities based on the 'Mutation Level' parameter (1-5).

[INPUT]
- Original prompt text (input)
- Number of variants to generate (num_variants)
- Substring to change (substring)
- Mutation level (mutation_level)

[OUTPUT]
- JSON-formatted object containing:
  - "substring": The original substring to be replaced
  - "variants": An array of variant prompts (length equal to num_variants)
- DO NOT include any output other than the JSON object. Do not output any additional text, explanation or comments.

[INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Carefully analyze the image prompt text
2. Identify the specified substring within the prompt
3. For each variant:
   a. Replace the substring with contextually appropriate artistic alternatives
   b. Ensure the replacement explores different visual possibilities
   c. Maintain coherent prompt structure and compatibility with AI image generators
4. Generate the specified number of variants
5. Format the output as a JSON object
6. DO NOT include any output other than the JSON object. Do not output any additional text, explanation or comments.

[CONSIDERATIONS]
- Focus on artistic elements like style, medium, lighting, composition, mood
- Ensure replacements are compatible with AI image generation syntax
- Maintain proper prompt structure and formatting
- Consider how changes affect the overall visual outcome
- Keep variants concise and clear for optimal generation results
