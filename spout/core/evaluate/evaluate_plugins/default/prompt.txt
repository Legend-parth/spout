[OBJECTIVE]
Evaluate and rank the provided inputs based on the specified judging criteria.

[RULES]
1. Split the **Combined Inputs** using the specified **Separator**.
2. For each input:
   - If a label is present (enclosed within `--`), extract it as the **Name**. If the label exceeds 16 characters, use it; otherwise, use the first 16 characters of the label as the **Name**.
   - If no label is present:
     - For short inputs (<=50 characters), use the entire input as the **Name**.
     - For longer inputs (>50 characters), generate a label like "Input 1", "Input 2", etc., as the **Name**.
   - Extract the main text following the label (if present).
3. Parse the **Judging Criteria**:
   - If weights are included (formatted as `Criterion:Weight`), apply them to prioritize the criteria.
   - If no weights are provided, treat all criteria with equal importance.
4. Evaluate each input based on the **Judging Criteria** in the order provided.
5. Assign numerical scores (e.g., 1 to 10) for each criterion.
6. Calculate a total score for each input by summing the weighted scores.
7. Rank the inputs from highest to lowest based on their total scores.
8. If **Explanation** is set to `true`, provide a brief (up to two sentences each) explanation for each ranking.
9. Structure the results in the specified **Output Format** (JSON).
10. Do no include any explanations comments or other extraneous text outside of the JSON output.
