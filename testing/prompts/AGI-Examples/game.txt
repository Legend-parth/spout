Design a web based game with React and Typescript. It should be modeled in graphics and game-play after the early 1990s DOS game: *The Oregon Trail*, except the written content and graphics all be procedurally generated with generative AI. When beginning a new game, the player should be able to select any location and period in history, and the images and text should be generated accordingly. For example, if a player picks Central America in 1460 AD, the game should involve mesoamerican pre-Columbian history and cultures. If there is not sufficient historical information, randomly generated content should be used as appropriate to make the plot interesting and fun.
